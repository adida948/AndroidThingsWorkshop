# AndroidThingsWorkshop

Welcome to the Android Things workshop.

This workshop consists in four lessons that ideally should be done in order
* [Lesson one](https://github.com/jamescoggan/AndroidThingsWorkshop/blob/master/task_one_led_and_button.md): Connect an LED and Button to the Android Things
* [Lesson Two](https://github.com/jamescoggan/AndroidThingsWorkshop/blob/master/task_two_temperature_sensor.md): Connect an I2C Temperature sensor to the Android Things
* [Lesson Three](https://github.com/jamescoggan/AndroidThingsWorkshop/blob/master/task_three_firebase.md): Connect the Android Things to Firebase
* [Lesson Four](https://github.com/jamescoggan/AndroidThingsWorkshop/blob/master/task_four_google_assistant.md): Connect everything together with the Google Assistant

The final result can be seen in [this branch](https://github.com/jamescoggan/AndroidThingsWorkshop/tree/firebase_observe_data):

Time to get started, load the [first lesson](https://github.com/jamescoggan/AndroidThingsWorkshop/blob/master/task_one_led_and_button.md)!
